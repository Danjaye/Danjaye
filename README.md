What's up guys, I'm Daniel Jaye.

Currently, my website is having a stroke, so if you want to know more about me this is the place to be.

### Who is Daniel Jaye!?
*I'm* Daniel Jaye. Danjaye. Hope we've established that.

### In what do you specialize?
I don't specialize. Instead, I write in a variety of languages. My knowledge encapsulates:

1. **Python.** I don't especially love Python, but I sure know it. The only place I've used it publicly is my discord bot, which now is getting rewritten in Node or something JavaScript-y, so... yeah.
2. **JavaScript.** I just mentioned this, so you were expecting it. Yes, you were, don't say you weren't! Wait, you actually weren't? Well, then. Surprise. I know JavaScript and have been writing it for a while. I use it in websites like [SuperBlog](https://superblog.danjaye.repl.co) and [Simple Chat](https://simple-chat.danjaye.repl.co). Before those, I hadn't, actually.
3. **PHP.** Ah, yes, PHP. My initial language. Rather, the first language I bothered to learn. Rather, the first language that actually served any use in a dynamic page, one where you can blog and stuff. [SuperBlog](https://superblog.danjaye.repl.co) is the most prominent of the few I wrote in this language.
4. **HTML and CSS.** Not sure if these count as languages, but, you know, they're there. There's a lot of projects I've made with these two.
5. **C#.** Now we're getting a LITTLE out-of-hand, but I have learned a small amount of C#, because, well, Unity. Game development and that jazz.

### Are you a boy or a girl?
I'm a Caucasian male that's 7 feet tall with shining, lustrious black hair and a bulging pectoral region.
